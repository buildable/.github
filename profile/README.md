[Buildable](https://buildable.dev/) is the easiest way to collect, transform, send and action your backend system events. Buildable simplifies the process of collecting event data from your disparate systems and connecting new tools to action those events, allowing you to spend more of your engineering time on things that matter.

When you capture event data in Buildable, you can send them in real-time to your databases, sales, analytics, payment, communication and eCommerce tools. In most cases, you'll be able to set up a Connection once and forget about it forever.
